%% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -*- Prime Power Delay-Line Lengths -*- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ %%
% DESCRIPTION
%   it is convenient to choose each delay-line length M_i, as an integer
%   power of a distinct prime number p_i. With this choice, the
%   delay-line lengths are always coprime.

% INPUT
%   - N     : numbers of delay lines
%   - fs    : sampling frequency
%   - t     : first delay in ms

% OUTPUT
%   - m     : desired delay time in samples
